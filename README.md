# qosftask4

there was 4 task in screening task stage.i have solved task1 ,task2,task3 like problems in different competitions like ibm quantum challenge and qhack and got good rank.this time i wanted  different kind of challenge  which won't just take me into out of my comfort zone , will give me a good field of research and developement.that's why i have chosen task 4 because it would take me out of my comfort zone.i have read several papers about decomposition, and several papers about reduction and finally reinforcement learning one of my favourite technique to use for reduction which will be under development after the judgement is finished. i want to further research about this task and develope to make my technique robust. my motivation was to take a pure mathematics type reseach and coding  and learning new algorithms. i alawya want to take harder route because it gives me motivation to work harder and with heart.
